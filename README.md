# Hand_Gesture
## Overview
This project is a culmination of three separate methods in computer vision to detect hand gestures.  The first uses basic image thresholding with openCV in order to find contours of fingers after applying a mask.  The second uses machine learning principles in pytorch to create a CNN for image classification.  The third uses object detection with YOLOv5 in order to recognize all the letters of the alphabet in Sign Language (J and Z edited).  You can learn more about each project, as well as how to run them, in their individual README.md's.  Below are instructions on setting up a virtual environment that will be able to run all three projects. There is also a brief report on what I learned about machine learning and my thoughts on improvements.
